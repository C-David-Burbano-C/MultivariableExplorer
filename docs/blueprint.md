# **App Name**: Multivariable Explorer

## Core Features:

- Function Input & Parsing: Accepts user-defined functions of two or three variables and uses AI tools to automatically parse and normalize mathematical expressions into JavaScript functions suitable for plotting. 
- 2D/3D Visualization: Dynamically renders graphs of functions, either as curves in 2D or surfaces in 3D, based on the parsed mathematical expressions.
- Partial Derivative Calculation: Calculates partial derivatives of user-defined functions at specified points and displays them, enhancing understanding of rate of change.
- Multiple Integral Calculation: Calculates double or triple integrals over specified regions to find volumes or other integral properties.
- Domain & Range Analysis: Computes and displays the domain and range of functions to ensure valid parameter inputs for calculation.  The application leverages symbolic tool to reason about boundary and limiting conditions.
- Surface Gradient Visualization: Displays gradient vectors on the surface plots of 3D functions, illustrating the direction of the steepest ascent at any point.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#6666FF) to provide a sense of depth and intellectual exploration, contrasting subtly with brighter elements to maintain readability.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F0F0) to offer a clean, neutral backdrop that minimizes distraction, ideal for detailed visual analysis.
- Accent color: Electric Purple (#BF40BF) as a high-contrast complement that highlights key interactive elements and results, creating a vivid call to action and enhancing usability.
- Body text: 'Inter' sans-serif font provides clarity for both textual descriptions and interface elements, ensuring readability without visual clutter.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' is for headlines; its distinct letterforms pair well with the 'Inter' body text
- Minimalist icons that are universally recognizable, to guide users through the functionalities and enhance intuitive interaction.
- Clean and intuitive grid-based layout ensuring elements are logically placed, offering ease of use and quick access to all mathematical tools and visualizations.
